_TL;DR: This branch is abandoned._

I decided this design was poor in some aspects, and am currently redesigning and rewriting the whole stack.
Given (I assume) this repository has probably not been used elsewhere, I'm going to replace `master` with a brand-new branch once it's done.
This branch has been renamed to `old`, will no longer be updated, and will eventually be migrated to a tag.
